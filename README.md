# Personal website
This is supposed to be my personal website, containing all relevant links and some info about me.
Some of the content is rendered from json files via react, allowing me to easily edit the content of the site without touching the html.
It is hosted via github and is available [here](https://casparbo.github.io)

## Todo
- move cv content to json via react
- shorten cv so it fits on two pages
